\section{Introduction}

The \texttt{libmoeprlnc} library implements the encoding and decoding of generations in
random linear network coding. It is based on the \texttt{libmoepgf} library, which in turn
implements the required Galois Field operations.

The \texttt{libmoeprlnc} (also referred to as \texttt{rlnc library} in the following) does not yet have an 
adequate testing suit. Our group proposes a validation tool for the \texttt{rlnc library} which mainly tries to 
find unexpected bugs by executing the libraries functions in a random order.

In addition to bugs in the code that might lead to a crash, we have also made it our task to check the functionality 
of the library by means of statistical evaluations.

This paper documents of the proposed tool, as well as the results of our evaluation.

\section{Approach}\label{app}

\subsection{Brief Description of the \texttt{rlnc library}}\label{app:desc}
The following will briefly describe the functionality of the main interfaces, the \texttt{rlnc library} offers.
This will help to understand the presented approach as well as our code.

First of all, the library uses a data structure called \texttt{rlnc\_block} which is the libraries representation of a generation.
Since our tool also has an abstraction of a generation, in the following the term "rlnc\_block" describes this libraries data structure and 
"generation" the abstraction of our tool. Besides this data structure, the library offers four main interfaces: 
\texttt{rlnc\_block\_add()}, \texttt{rlnc\_block\_encode()}, \texttt{rlnc\_block\_decode()} and \texttt{rlnc\_block\_get()}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \underline{\texttt{rlnc\_block\_add(rlnc\_block\_t b, int pv, const uint8\_t *data, size\_t len)}}\\
    Reads the data of size \texttt{len} from \texttt{*data} and adds it to the \texttt{rlnc\_block} \texttt{b}. Pivot (\texttt{pv}) describes the index of the data in the generation. 
    (TODO @Tobi ist das richtig mit dem pivot?). 

    \item \underline{\texttt{rlnc\_block\_encode(const rlnc\_block\_t b, uint8\_t *dst, size\_t maxlen, int flags)}}\\
    Randomly encodes data from the \texttt{rlnc\_block} \texttt{b} and returns the coded data at \texttt{*dst}. 
    \texttt{maxlen} describes the aligned length of the buffer \texttt{dst}. The alignment is chosen at the initialization of the \texttt{rlnc\_block}.
    
    \item \underline{\texttt{rlnc\_block\_decode(rlnc\_block\_t b, const uint8\_t *src, size\_t len)}}\\
    Receives coded data in \texttt{src} which is of length \texttt{len} and adds it to \texttt{rlnc\_block} \texttt{b}. 
    Then the \texttt{rlnc\_block} is decoded as far as possible. 
    Consequently, any linear dependencies that may have arisen are eliminated by this method. If rank(b) is 
    equal to the generation size after the execution of this method, the holder of \texttt{b} has decoded to full generation.

    \item \underline{\texttt{rlnc\_block\_get(rlnc\_block\_t b, int pv, uint8\_t *dst, size\_t maxlen)}}\\
    If the requested data has already been decoded, the function returns the data of \texttt{rlnc\_block} \texttt{b} at index \texttt{pv} in buffer 
    \texttt{dst} of size \texttt{maxlen} (aligned).
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Building the Tool}\label{app:build}
TODO: Dependencies + build-steps... Also wsl. einfach README reinkopieren. 

\subsection{The Tool and Its Program Flow}\label{sec:tool}
Generally, our tool simulates the communication between two partners A and B. 
A holds a Generation containing randomly generated bytes. Using the \texttt{rlnc library}, A transmits coded information to B. 
During this process, coded data might be lost with a user-defined probability. When B receives the coded information, 
it adds it to its own \texttt{rlnc\_block} and tries to decode it. Decoded data might then be consumed and added to the Generation B.

There are checks distributed in the code, that verify whether return values are as expected or 
the library itself throws errors. If there is an an unexpected behavior detected or the library itself returns an error, 
the tool terminates and outputs what happened.

To simulate the presented communication flow, our tool mainly introduces the following three function:

create\_at\_A() extracts the next frame from Generation A and adds it to the underlying \texttt{rlnc\_block}. 

transmit\_A2B() represents a transmission between A and B. Therefore, coded data is generated from the 
\texttt{rlnc\_block} which is held by A (if the block is not empty). Then, the coded data might either be 'lost' 
with the user-defined loss probability (the function returns without further actions)
or it is added to the \texttt{rlnc\_block} held by B. By adding coded data to a \texttt{rlnc\_block} the library will try to decode the block as far as possible
and therefore eliminate any linear dependencies that might have been added to the \texttt{rlnc\_block B}.

consume\_at\_B() represents the consumption of decoded data on the B side. 
The tool tries to read the next available decoded data and (if available) adds it to the Generation B.

For better clarity of the flow of data, all three functions are shown in Figure \ref{fig:func}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \center
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[draw] at (0, 2)   (ga) {Generation A};
    \node[draw] at (0, 0)   (ba) {\texttt{rlnc\_block} A};
    \node[draw] at (6, 2)   (gb) {Generation B};
    \node[draw] at (6, 0)   (bb) {\texttt{rlnc\_block} B};
    \draw [thick,->] (ga) -- (ba) node[midway,left] {create\_at\_A()};
    \draw [thick,->] (ba) -- (bb) node[midway,below] {transmit\_A2B()};
    \draw [thick,->] (bb) -- (gb) node[midway,right] {consume\_at\_B()};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Data Flow}
  \label{fig:func}
\end{figure}

During the whole process, our tool mainly distinguishes between two modes that strongly influence the program flow. 
The random mode and the prefill mode mode. 
The idea behind the random mode is basically a random execution of the interfaces provided by the library under test, 
to especially detect bugs that occur only in very rare edge cases.
In general, the prefill mode is more deterministic and is better suited for 
statistical analysis for various reasons, which will be explained in more detail below.

During the execution of the program, various information relevant for a statistical evaluation can be collected and output in a CSV file.

\subsubsection{The random mode}\label{sec:random}
During an iteration in random mode, the tool repeatedly chooses one of the three functions, introduced in Section \ref{sec:tool}, 
to be called, each with probability $\frac{1}{3}$. 

An iteration was successful if Generation A and B contain the same data after consume\_at\_B() consumed the last data.

This way, it is possible to randomly generate numerous scenarios, when testing enough iteration. 
Especially edge-case scenarios like the following ones are tested:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{rlnc\_block B} is still empty and we try to read decoded frames from it.
  \item \texttt{rlnc\_block A} is empty and the program tries to generate coded data from it and transmit it.
  \item \texttt{rlnc\_block A} is only partly filled and the program already starts transmitting.
  \item \texttt{rlnc\_block B} has already full rank, but there is still coded data transmitted.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The prefill mode}\label{sec:prefill}
However, the random mode comes with some challenges if one wants to make meaningful and reliable statistical 
evaluations of the program output.

In random mode it may happen that the \texttt{rlnc\_block} already contains all required information but due
to the random nature of the mode, the consuming function might not be called immediately.
Since we are often interested in how many transmissions it took at a minimum for B to decode the whole generation, this behavior 
might distort the number of required transmissions.

Furthermore, in random mode the tool will try to send already coded data while the \texttt{rlnc\_block} on the A side has not been completely filled yet. 
This results in the probability of sending linearly dependent data being very high at the beginning and decreasing over time. 
decreases over time.

To work around these problems, we have introduced the prefill mode.

The prefill mode fills the complete \texttt{rlnc\_block} of the A side at the beginning and keeps transmitting until the 
\texttt{rlnc\_block} of the B side has full rank. Then, all decoded data is consumed at once and it is checked 
whether generation A and B contain the same data.

\subsection{Command Line Parameters}\label{app:cmd}
The proposed tool accepts the following command line parameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item -c, \texttt{-{}-}csv\_stats\\
    Print statistics to CSV file in current working directory.

    \item -f, \texttt{-{}-}field\_size=SIZE\\
    Set underlaying Galois Field size. (0: GF2, 1: GF4, 2: GF16, 3: GF256).

    \item -g, \texttt{-{}-}gen\_size=SIZE\\
    Set the generation size.

    \item -i, \texttt{-{}-}nr\_iterations=ITER\\
    Set the amount of test iterations

    \item -l, \texttt{-{}-}loss\_rate=LOSS\\
    Set probability with which coded data is lost during transmission.

    \item -m, \texttt{-{}-}mode\\
    Executes the program in 'pre fill' mode.

    \item -p, \texttt{-{}-}pkt\_size=SIZE\\
    Set the frame size.

    \item -s, \texttt{-{}-}seed=ADDR\\
    Set the seed which is used to generate random test input.

    \item -v, \texttt{-{}-}verbose

    Produce verbose output.
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:eval}
\subsection{Important Change to the \texttt{rlnc Library}}
We had to extend the \texttt{rlnc library} by the function below, as the 
library does not offer the possibility to change the seed of a \texttt{rlnc\_block} from outside. The seed is 
initialized with zero when a \texttt{rlnc\_block} is created. This seed is then used by the rlnc\_block\_decode() 
method to pseudo randomly (\texttt{rand\_r(seed)}) combine data with each other. However, if the same seed is used, the 
data of Generation A will always be coded in the same sequence. 
While this behavior does not need to cause problems in a real-world application, it does make an statistical evaluation obsolete.

\lstset{language=C}
\begin{lstlisting}
  void rlnc_block_set_seed(rlnc_block_t b, unsigned seed){
    b->r_seed = seed;
    return;
  }
\end{lstlisting}

We use this function to give each \texttt{rlnc\_blocks} a unique seed before each iteration.

Note that there is a version of the code in the repository where the calls to this method 
have been commented out to ensure that the code works and compiles.

\subsection{Verification of the Decoding Probability}
According to the lecture, the probability that N randomly chosen coding vectors form
the complete N-dimensional vector space is given by equation \ref{eq:decode_prob}.
\begin{equation} 
  Pr[dim\bigcup_{i=1}^{N}\{c_i\} = N] = \prod_{i=1}^{N} (1 - \frac{q^{i - 1}}{q ^ {N}})
  \label{eq:decode_prob}
\end{equation}

Where N is the generation size and q the size of the underlying Galois Field ($q \in \{2,4,16,256\}$).

Applied to the context of our project, equation \ref{eq:decode_prob} gives us the probability that the 
\texttt{rlnc\_block} \texttt{b} can be completely decoded after exactly N transmissions.

\section{Validation of our Tool}\label{val}
TODO: Jonas meinte ja dass wir irgendwie zumindest im Ansatz unser Tool auch validieren sollen. 

\section{Conclusion}\label{con}
In this project, a tool for validating the \texttt{libmoeprlnc} was implemented, presented and successfully used 
to validate the library. 

During the entire working phase, no profound bugs could be identified.

In particular, the expected decoding probability presented in the lecture 
could also be verified in Section \ref{sec:eval}, which is another indication of the correctness of the library.

During the development only by an error of our side it was noticed that the method rlnc\_block\_decode() does not 
throw an error, although it gets a buffer with coded data, which is smaller than the data length defined 
at initialization. However, since coded data consists of the linear combination of data of the same length and 
the respective coding vector, the case described above should never occur.

Consequently, we suggest that rlnc\_block\_decode() should throw an error in this case. In all other methods, 
the library already shows such behavior and returns an error if an illogical buffer size is passed.

TODO: Man könnte nich erwähnen dass es sinnlos ist einen Seed im rlnc block zu haben, wenn der immer auf 0 steht

TODO: Irgendwo erwähnen, dass wir den random mode sehr viel haben laufen lassen und keinen Fehler feststellen konnten
